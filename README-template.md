## My process

### Built with

- html5
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Sass

### What I learned

Get the thing functional and looking vaguely similar and THEN tinker with the design to get it just right. 

### Continued development

I need more practice with layout stuff. I was thorougly confused and just stumped for a long time trying to figure out why my flexbox container wouldn't center. I'm still not 100% sure why, but it had something to do with the viewport height being in the wrong place.
